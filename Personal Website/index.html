        <p>Welcome to my personal site! The goal of this site is to provide the reader with information about myself, my career goals, as well as my work and educational experiences. I plan to incorporate a captivating design, images, and engage the reader but keep a very business professional look to the overall design.  <br>
          My name is Greg Sandoval and I am a student at the University of New Mexico. I have two more years until I complete my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree where I plan to use my major in Communication on a career in sports and media. I hope to focus on all types of sports - from the digital world to the physical, I am a fan of watching competitive matches playout across any stage. In this career I would like to bring marketing and communication business solutions to teams and athletes across the nation. <br>
          My passion has always been in sports, and later in the design and development of content. As I grow my education in Communication, I hope to provide more work and experience in copy writing and editing. I have experience in creating marketing assets and continue to take courses that allow me to develop my skills more. I hope to bring these two together to provide exceptional solutions to businesses.<br>
        In this site, you&rsquo;ll be able to learn more about myself, design portfolio, and the work I&rsquo;ve done. If you have any questions or would like to connect with me on any topic, please visit the <strong>Contact </strong>page. </p>
