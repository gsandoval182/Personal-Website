          Major: Communications <br>
          Minor: Management<br>
          Excerpt from the University of New Mexico Communications Department Mission Statement: <br>
  <em>Communication is the focus of our scholarship and curricula with emphasis on the understanding and appreciation of diverse messages and meanings.  Our scholarship and teaching explore the social skills, societal dynamics, and professional environments of communication from a variety of standpoints: intercultural, interpersonal, rhetorical, health, organizational, environmental, strategic, broadcasting, print journalism, and mass communication.</em></p>
        <h2> Communications </h2>
        <p>I am a Junior at the University of New Mexico working on a Bachelor of Arts in Communications with a minor in Management. My emphasis in this degree is in Media Studies which allows for students to study the principles and theories of mass communication systems in the United States. <br>
          Social Media has taken the globe by storm, having grown up in the realm of computers and the internet I found vast interest in how communications take off virtually. Better understanding how to communicate across virtual communities is key – as we don&rsquo;t have the social cues we can rely on in person. </p>
        <h2> Marketing </h2>
        <p>I have always loved to design – from drawing on pen and paper, to developing my ideas out in Photoshop and Illustrate. Adobe Creative Cloud and other services has allowed me to bring my designs to life. Although I focus mostly on sports, I do enjoy designing assets surrounding music and fashion. </p>
